This study explores the psychological and social benefits of watching football as a hobby. The researchers found that being a fan of a football team enhances a sense of belonging, fosters social connections, and improves mood and general well-being. Watching football games can reduce stress and increase feelings of excitement and camaraderie among fans. The study highlights how shared experiences during football matches strengthen interpersonal relationships and contribute positively to mental health.
